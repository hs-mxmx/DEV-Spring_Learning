# Spring-Learning
Projects based on [Spring Boot Complete Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvR-Oif_nxg) by **Master class**, following and creating demos based on the references.

## Projects
**01-spring-demo-project**: First project resolving main configuration on pom.xml and spring.xml (resources). It's composed by two mini-projects (_demo & demo_spring_components_):
- **demo**: Project based on spring.xml manual bean configuration
- **demo_spring_components**: Project based on bean.config file (without xml file reference)

**02-spring-demo-project**: Second project implementing **AOP** annotations in order to implement crossharing functions (logging, authentication, sanitization, pointcuts...) in order to split business logic with crossharing modules.
